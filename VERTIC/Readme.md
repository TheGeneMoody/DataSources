# üîê VERTIC Dataset Schema  
### Vulnerability Exploitation Real-Time Intel & Context

> **VERTIC** is a structured dataset designed to track the real-world lifecycle of exploited vulnerabilities (CVEs). It provides technical and executive stakeholders with enriched timelines, contextual intelligence, financial impact, and attacker behavior data to support enterprise risk analysis and threat modeling.
